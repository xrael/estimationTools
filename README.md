# estimationTools

Python code to simulate dynamic systems and filtering problems (batch, kalman, extendedkalman, etc).

It includes:
- Batch filter
- Considered batch filter.
- CKF.
- Considered CKF.
- EKF.
- UKF.
- SRIF.
with an interface ready to create new sequential filters.

It also include models for orbit and attitude estimation problems:
- Two-body dynamics.
- Zonal harmonics.
- Drag.
- Solar radiation pressure.
- Third-body dynamics.
- Euler's Equation.

Observers:
- Range, Range-rate.
- Right ascension, declination.
- Rate-gyro.
- MRPs observer.
- Star tracker with a 57 star catalog.
